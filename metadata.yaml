description: This beginning-part is not made out of anybody's head, you know. It's
  real. You must believe this beginning-part more than what comes after, else you
  won't understand how what comes after came to be written. You must believe it all;
  but you must believe this most, please. I am the editor of it. Bob Redforth (he's
  my cousin, and shaking the table on purpose) wanted to be the editor of it; but
  I said he shouldn't because he couldn't.
